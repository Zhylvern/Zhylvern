# Hi!

I code for fun.  

### My Public Projects:
- [OpenCount](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/opencount/) – A lightweight browser extension that tracks visit counts and active time by domain. Because sometimes, you just need to know how much time you’re wasting.
- [OpenRequest](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/openrequest/) – A lightweight browser extension that reveals exactly what POST data your browser is sending, giving developers, researchers, and privacy‑conscious users instant visibility into hidden traffic.

### Check Out My Site:
- [Littlebranch PH](https://www.littlebranchph.com/) – A platform for kids' activities in the Philippines.

### Skills:
- ☕ Drinking coffee (and pretending it's doing something productive)
- 💤 Lacking sleep (but still pushing through)
- 💧 Drinking water (because hydration is important, I guess)

P.S. If you think I know what I'm doing... I probably don’t, but it works!
